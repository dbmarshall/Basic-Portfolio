        <img src="assets/images/David-OldTown-Jerusalem.jpg" alt="me">
        <p>I know my way around the front-end of web development, rising to peripheral challenges that have arisen over the years, a jack of all trades when needed.  I've managed projects, done some SEO, and lots more.  I've touched countless different technologies, lately focusing more on single-page applications.</p>
        <p>On a personal level, I've collectively managed an all-volunteer, open-publishing social justice news website since 2004, as well as doing my own independent reporting, photography, and videography.  When not doing any of that, I love to unplug in the mountains during the winters, an avid snowboarder who loves deep powder.</p>
